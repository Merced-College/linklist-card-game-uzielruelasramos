What I Added To The Code: 

Created methods in CardGame.java class to implement a simple Blackjack game. 
It is a text based game where the user plays against the computer.

-------------------------------
Game Rules:

1. The user and computer each start with drawing 2 cards from a shuffled deck.
2. The goal of the game is to have a hand value taken from the cards in hand as close to 21 without going over it. 
3. The user can choose to draw another card, hit, or end their turn, stand.
4. The computer will draw cards until it reaches 17 or more.
5. Like in classic blackjack rules, the player closes to 21 without busting wins. 

-------------------------------

Where Linked List is Used:

The deck of cards is implemented using a linked list.
The LinkList.java class manages the cards that are being read from the cards.txt file.
The cards are then drawn using getFirst(), removes and returns the first card.
I implement these methods from the LinkedList.java class into my Blackjack game.

-------------------------------
How to Play:

The program is a text based game so the user would have to use the terminal to play.

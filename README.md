What I Added to the Code: 

Created methods in CardGame.java class to implement a simple Blackjack game. 
It is a text based game where the user plays against the computer.

-------------------------------
Game Rules:

1. The user and computer each start with drawing 2 cards from a shuffled deck.
2. The goal of the game is to have a hand value taken from the cards in hand as close to 21 without going over it. 
3. The user can choose to draw another card, hit, or end their turn, stand.
4. The computer will draw cards until it reaches 17 or more.
5. Like in classic blackjack rules, the player closes to 21 without busting wins. 

-------------------------------
How to play:

The program is a text based game so the user would have to use the terminal to play.
